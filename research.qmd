# Research

I work on problems related to precision poultry nutrition, stochastic feed formulation, and nutrient variability.

## Current Projects

- **Stochastic Feed Formulation** — integrating nutrient variability into diet models.
- **Soybean Meal Quality** — modeling processing effects on digestibility.
- **Broiler Breeder Precision Nutrition** — evaluating nutritional strategies under heat stress.
- **Nutrient Variability in Feed Ingredients** — quantifying and classifying variability in nutrient profiles.
